Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
Idea

Develop a robust sentiment analysis model to classify text data from social media and app reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, providing actionable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experience.

Description

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to preprocess text, extract meaningful features, and accurately predict sentiment. Models used include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and optionally DistilBERT for deep learning-based classification.

Datasets

Twitter Dataset: Twitter_Data_Cleaned.csv – contains tweets and their sentiment labels.

App Reviews Dataset: cleaned_apps.csv – contains app reviews with ratings, used to create sentiment labels.

Key Concepts

Sentiment Analysis: Detect emotional tone in text data.

NLP: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Machine Learning: Classical and transformer-based models for classification.

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization and extraction of relevant features to improve model performance.

Data Visualization: Confusion matrices, sentiment distribution plots, and word clouds for clear insights.

Features

Preprocessing of raw text (removing URLs, mentions, punctuation, stopwords)

TF-IDF vectorization for classical ML models

Classical ML: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM

Transformer model (optional): DistilBERT for advanced sentiment classification

Custom predictions on new text inputs

Visualization of model performance and sentiment distributions
