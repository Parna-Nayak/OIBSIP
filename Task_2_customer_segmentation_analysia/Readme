Cluster Overview

Your dataset has been segmented into 4 clusters using K-Means on Income, Total_Spending, Total_Purchases, and Recency. Each cluster shows distinct behavior patterns:

1. Income vs Spending (Top-Left Graph)

High Income, High Spending (Cluster 0): Premium customers with high purchasing power.

Low Income, Low Spending (Cluster 1): Budget-conscious or infrequent buyers.

Medium Income, Medium Spending (Clusters 2 & 3): Moderate or regular shoppers.

Recommendation:

Target high-income, high-spending customers with premium products and loyalty programs.

Engage low-income, low-spending customers with discounts or reactivation campaigns.

2. Purchases vs Spending (Top-Right Graph)

Frequent Buyers (Cluster 2): Medium spend but purchase often, providing steady revenue.

High spenders with fewer purchases (Cluster 0): Valuable customers who can be upsold.

Recommendation:

Use bundles, subscriptions, or cross-selling for frequent buyers.

Encourage high-value customers to purchase more often with personalized offers.

3. Average Spending per Cluster (Bottom-Left Graph)

Shows revenue contribution per segment.

High-spending clusters (Cluster 0) should be prioritized for retention.

Low-spending clusters (Cluster 1 & 3) may require promotions to increase engagement.

4. Average Income per Cluster (Bottom-Right Graph)

Confirms the purchasing power of each cluster.

Helps tailor product offerings:

Premium/Luxury products → high-income clusters.
